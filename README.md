# workflow-of-chromothripsis
this workflow is the Pipeline of chromothripsis in CC-LY lab.
1. Using BulkRNAseq to predict fusion-gene
2. Using BulkRNAseq to predict SNP and CNV
3. Using Whole-genome-sequence to find SNP and CNV
4. Using Whole-genome-sequence to find structure variants.

- As the reference data of human are much more sufficient than and mouse, this pipeline split into two parts. One of them is used on human data, and the other one is used on mouse data.
  - If you want use `genomics piepline` on **human data**, you could access the detail info by clicking
  - If you want use `genomics piepline` on [**mouse data**], you could access the detail info by clicking
